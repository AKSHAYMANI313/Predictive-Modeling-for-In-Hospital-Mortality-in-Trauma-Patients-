# This Code showcases the development of a multivariate logistic regression model using both categorical and continuous predictors of a basic level "trauma patients survival data" to predict a health-related outcome. The model was built using R and fine-tuned through various preprocessing, diagnostic, and optimization techniques.

#Key steps in the project:

#1)Model Construction: A multivariate logit model was built incorporating both categorical and continuous predictors.

#2)Data Transformation: Nonlinear continuous variables were identified using a Lowess smoother and transformed using the FracPoly method.

#3)Model Optimization: Influential data points were identified and removed based on diagnostic tests, improving model fit.

#4)Model Selection: By eliminating predictor terms with higher p-values, the model was optimized for better performance.

#5)Enhanced Predictive Accuracy: The addition of the "physical fitness" variable significantly improved the modelâ€™s predictive power.--- CONVERT THIS PARA ALONE- NOTHING ELSE  TO R PROGRAM FORMAT - MENTION THAT THIS IS SURVIVAL DATA
